Car race game for Raanana Tira project

Race project

    Goals

    Make sure every participant ends up writing and understanding a Python class

    Create competition to engage the participants

    Have fun

    How

    Devide participants into 2-4 mixed groups

    Each group writes a class that implements a Raceable interface we provide

    Sample classes: car, bike, humanoids...

    The task for each group is to provide a class which will race against other group classes.

    We should provide a black box that reads the classes and uses the race method along with other methods (override obstacles?) to generate the competition
