### Running multiple drivers

## Improving drivers

### Moving out to track

### Competing with your classmates' drivers

- Finding ip address<br>
Look for an address that starts with 10.35
```
ip addr
```
- Connecting rose-client to remote machine<br>
For example, in order to compete with client `foo.py` on `10.35.1.2`:
```
./rose-client -s 10.35.1.2 foo.py
```
