# Adding test files for Python

## Setting up
To add a test file:
1. You should name it according to the `exercise/homework` theme.
2. For every test function, add an appropriate decorator (aka `mark` in pytest). Use the same `mark('@pytest.mark.<topic>')` for tests you would like to run together. For example: `@pytest.mark.variables` for variables homework check.
3. In order for `pytest` to recognize the new marks, you need to add them to the `pytest.ini` file.
4. Each function in the test file should be named: `test_exercise_#` and should invoke `helpers` as input. For example: `def test_variables_1(helpers)`
5. The `helpers` is defined by `pytest fixture` and creates a `Helpers class` that stores our check values and the functions for the testing.

## Variables in the test files:

Each test needs the following variables:
1. **helpers.student_file**:  
   Stores the path for student file for testing.
   'set_student_file` function appends automatically the HOME directory or the directory we supplied to the name of the student file according to the homework instructions.

2. **helpers.expected_pycode** (list):  
   Should include code/text we expect in the student answer file and the error message to be displayed.  
   The expected values should be supplied as string or in regex format.  
   An example for checking code:  
   ```
   helpers.expected_pycode = [[r'^.*x *= *9.*', 'x should equal 9'], 
                              [r'^.*print\(.*z.*\).*',
                                 'please use the print function']]
   ```
   You can also add a check for working but not optimal code by using the following:  
   ```
   helpers.expected_pycode = [[r"f'best \{solution\}",
                               [r"other correct solution",
                                'explenation for better solution',
                                'error message']]]
   ```

3. **helpers.input**(list):
   Should include all the inputs we want to check.  
   For example: `helpers.input = [['10', '3'], ['5', '6']]`, will check 2 pairs of input.

4. **helpers.expected_stdout**(list):  
   Should include the output we expect to get and the error message to be displayed.  
   An example for 4 printouts that can be prefixed with text:  
   ```
   helpers.expected_stdout = [[[r'.*30', r'.*7', r'.*' + str(10/3), r'.*1'],
                               'the expected output is...']]
   ```

## Under the hood (using pytest):

- rose_check.py calls pytest when `-t <mark>` is invoked
- pytest.ini sets the parameters for the pytest run:
  - addopts: runs pytest using cmdline arguments
    - --tb=no to hide long trace output
    - -v for verbose, shows PASSED/FAILED
    - --no-header, --no-summary - hides those parts of outputs
  - markers - all our marks(decorators) should be registered here for pytest to recognize them.
  - log_cle - specify which log to show on live log. Use `LOGGER.error(message)` to show output to the user (also available `LOGGER.info/warning`).
