## List

### lists.py

Create a file *lists.py*

Note: If you want to add a comment in your code, you can add #. 
Python will ignore each line that starts with # and will not try to run it as a code
Comments can be used to explain Python code and  make the code more readable.
for example:

    # This is a comment
    print("Hello, World!")



Before each exercise, write in a comment the exercise number, for example:

    # 1 - create a list
    list1 = []
    list2 = list()
    # 2 - slicing a list

#### Create a list 

1. Create two empty lists and named them **list1** and **list2**. Create those empty lists in two different ways.
2. Create a list with the following numbers: 2,3,4,5,6 the list name should be **l1**
3. Print the index of the number 6
4. Append the numbers 7 and 8 to the end of **l1**
5. Print the length of the **l1**
6. Add the number 1 to the **l1**, 1 should be the first item on the list

#### Slicing a list

1. Print first 4 numbers of **l1**. 
2. Print 4 last numbers of **l1**. 
3. Print the two numbers in the middle
4. Print l1[20], which error did you get? What does this error say? (write your answer in a comment #)
	
#### Update the list 

1. Remove the items 4 and 5 from the **l1** and print **l1**.
2. Create a new list - **l2**, with the items: -1, -2 ,-3 and print **l2**.
3. Create a new list **l3** with the items of **l1** and **l2**, print **l3**.
4. Sort **l3** and print the sorted list.
5. Print the length of **l1**, **l2**, and **l3**.
