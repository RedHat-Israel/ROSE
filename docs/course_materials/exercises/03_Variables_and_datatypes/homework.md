## Strings

Before answering the questions:
1. Create a new directory Homework3
2. In the Homework3 directory create a new file for each question 
*Please submit just python files that you ran !!!*

### Names.py

"You have to spend X*T minutes this week to complete ROSE homework"
X - The number of questions

### Letter.py
Write a python code that accepts date, name,  address1, and address2 (as we learned in the last lesson)
The code should print the following output:

        <date>

    s = ‘work hard dream big’ 
Perform the following functions:
1. Use the “title()” function on the string variable and print it.
2. Print the length of the string by length() function.
3. Use the “replace(...,...)” function and replace the first word with the last word.
4. Use the “find()” function to know where is the ‘w’ word in the string.
