● "The number is greater than 1000" if the number is greater than 1000 
● otherwise "The number is less than 1000"

## while loop

### while_average.py
Write a Python program that gets integer numbers from the user in a loop (use 'input'),
The loop should break when the user enters the number 0.
At the end, the program will print the sum and the average of the numbers.

for example: 

the user input is : 15, 16, 12, 0
The output should be: 
Sum of 15 + 16  + 12 = 43 
Average of the numbers = 14.3 

### postitive_negative.py

and at the end it should display the count of positive, negative and zeros entered. 


## for loop

### ten.py

### natural.py
Write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural number.

### divided_by_5.py
