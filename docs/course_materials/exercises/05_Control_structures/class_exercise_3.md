### Let's Practice Together \#3

Create a file *sum.py*
- In this file, write a program that accept a number from the user.
- The program calculates the sum of all numbers between 1 and the given number.  
- For example: user gives 10 so the output should be 55.  
  ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55 )
